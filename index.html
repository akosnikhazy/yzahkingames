		<h2>Cupig's Key Collectathon</h2>
		<p>Cupig's Key Collectathon is a simple puzzle game where you collect keys to open treasure chests. Your speed is measured, you go for speed. I create this game to learn game creation from zero to Steam release.</p>
		<p>I don't expect this game to be a success, I don't even think people will buy it. But it is perfect to learn the ropes, to learn the principles of game development and also to learn how Steam works.</p>
		<p>Cupig's Key Collectathon has language support for several languages, Steam achievements and controller support.</p>

		<h2>Next game</h2>
		<p>Like any indiedev, I have not even finished or released the game I am making, but I am already thinking about the next one. I have some ideas about it. But the only thing I can tell you is that it will be a <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a> game.</p>
