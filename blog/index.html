    </a><span class="posttime">2025-06-24</span>
    <span class="postfirstparagraph">The first <a href="https://yzahkin.games/blog/posts/2025-06-05/on-steam.html">upload</a> of the game to Steam ended in rejection (they found bugs that prevented changing the language with the controller, despite me telling them it had full controller support, fair). So I worked more on the game. This event prompted me to fix some bugs and levels.</span>

    <span class="postfirstparagraph">I finally put my game on Steam! Within a day, I had fixed a bunch of levels, tested the achievements, and fixed a bug that prevented the game from saving high scores after level 30.</span>

    <span class="postfirstparagraph">I don't have time. Actually, I do. The truth is, I'm not motivated. Nevertheless, I had a small burst of motivation and did a lot of work on the game.</span>

    <span class="postfirstparagraph">From the beginning of the development of Cupig's Key Collectathon, I had a counter in the game that counted the times the player died. I had no real plan for it, but it was natural that it was there.</span>
