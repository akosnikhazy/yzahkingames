        <h1>I have no time</h1>

		<p>I don't have time. Actually, I do. The truth is, I'm not motivated. Nevertheless, I had a small burst of motivation and did a lot of work on the game.</p>
		<p>Every level is finished. I updated the level selector menu because it was too much work to make it by hand. I generated it with code! Incredible, right?</p>
		<p>I also hooked up every piece of music, one per world. I also fixed some old bugs that I had put off fixing. For example now the accessories of the Pig shows as intended.</p>
		<p>The game is ready for me to create a build and upload it to Steam sometime this week, so the Valve team can review it.</p>
		<p>I just want to be done with it.</p>
