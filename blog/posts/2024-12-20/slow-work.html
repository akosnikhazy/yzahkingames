        <h1>66 levels to go</h1>
        <div id="postedat">by Ákos <time datetime="2024-12-20">2024-12-20</time></div>
		<p>Here I am at the end of the year and I am way behind schedule. I finished the first world levels in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2999220/Cupigs_Key_Collectathon/">Cupig's Key Collectathon</a> and that is all.</p>
		<p>I started working on the water world levels. Two is done. The first tutorial level teaches the gimmick of the world: sharks. I also added floating bacon so the player knows there is danger.</p>
		<p>I wanted to finish level creation this year. But here I am in the last days of the year. The next two weeks are holidays. I really do not want to work on the game, and I will not even be near a computer to do so.</p>
		<p>So I just accept the fact: I failed to make the main part of the game this year. January will be the month when I will do it for sure. Maybe 😌</p>
		<p>I might just keep the February release. We will see. Steam will not accept it that fast for sure. So it will probably be March.</p>
		<p>Until then: have a Merry Christmas 🌲 and Happy New Year! 🎉</p>
