        <h1>Ukrainian translation and what else is needed for publishing</h1>
        <div id="postedat">by √Åkos <time datetime="2025-04-01">2025-04-01</time></div>
		<p>Today the Ukranian tranlation of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2999220/Cupigs_Key_Collectathon/">Cupig's Key Collectathon</a> is finished.</p>
		<p>It was made by one of my friends, Fil. She is a cosplayer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cassepupa">check out her work!</a></p>
		<p>Now that the translations are in (more were planned, but it will be English, Hungarian (these two I made), German and Ukrainian), I can do the next phase of development: putting builds on Steam.</p>
		<p>It will not be early access, this game is really made for success and it will never have enough content to make it a fun early access game. But I need to test the game in the Steam system. So my next goal is to put it on Steam and play it through to 100% to see how the achievements work, also to catch bugs before the final build.</p>
		<p>I still need to add music and some sound effects to the game. I have them ready. Also I changed the AudioManager class a little bit, now it has a seperate music method to control it. I do not know why I waited so long to do this.</p>
		<p>When will it be done? To quote a classic, <span class="i"><q>when it's done</q></span>. I will no longer say a month. 2025 is for sure. I want it done.</p>
