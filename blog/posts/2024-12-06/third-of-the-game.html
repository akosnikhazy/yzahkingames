        <h1>Making levels like crazy!</h1>
        <div id="postedat">by √Åkos <time datetime="2024-12-06">2024-12-06</time></div>
		<p>Creating levels for Cupig's Key Collectathon is not the easiest thing to do.</p>
		<p>Even with <a href="https://github.com/akosnikhazy/cupig-level-editor">the level editor</a>, each level takes a long time to make, because I have to come up with an idea of how to make it unique. Draw it out. Then trying to solve it by following the paths with my eyes. And finally, testing it in the actual game.</p>
		<p>There will be three types of levels: skill based, maze and fun. Skill based has a lot of dashes and the player has to be precise with the movement. Labyrinths are big and if you want to be fast, you have to learn the best way. Fun levels look strange or have a theme.</p>
		<p>I try to keep a balance between the three. I also try to make the game progressively harder. There are three worlds in the game. The first one is simple and there to learn the game. The second and third have their own gimmicks that make the game more complex.</p>
		<p>My plan is to finish the levels this year.</p>
