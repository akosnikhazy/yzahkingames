		<p>Since my next game will be made in the Godot Engine, I really need to learn how to use it. So I started a little side project to learn the basics.</p>
		<p>First, I made a <a href="https://github.com/akosnikhazy/godot-2d-reference">small reference project</a> based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0">this well-known tutorial</a>. I did not finish it because of time constraints. It is also not a project that will be useful later.</p>
		<p>What I am doing now is a real application that I will use later. Now I am writing this blog post by creating a new folder with an empty HTML file and then filling in the content. This is not too difficult. But I can do it better with a small exe file in Godot that creates this file with content for me. All I have to do is enter the title, description and text.</p>
		<p>This is a small and easy enough project to get a handle on Godot UI and coding ideas. It also makes my blogging pipeline even easier.</p>
