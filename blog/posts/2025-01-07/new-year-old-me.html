        <h1>Not the finish line, but close</h1>

		<p>After two weeks of doing nothing game-related, I finally got back to work on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2999220/Cupigs_Key_Collectathon/">Cupig's Key Collectathon</a>.</p>
		<p>I spent Christmas and New Year's Eve with family and friends. I had little time to work on the game. I managed to make two levels in an unexpected down time. But other than that: nothing happend. I spent Christmas and New Year's Eve with my family and friends. I had very little time to work on the game. I managed to make two levels in an unexpected downtime. But other than that, nothing happened.</p>
		<p>I spent the last two days working on the game. I created two cosmetic assets for the last world of the game. I also fixed the code to swap out these assets when needed.</p>
		<p>From an asset standpoint, the game still lacks the last world's environment and some salt and pepper here and there.</p>
		<p>January and February should be the two months where I finish the game. I have minimal outside interference, it all depends on me. The only thing out there is the translations. But for that I have to finish the English text. And for that I have to finish the levels first (so I know where and what tutorial text is needed).</p>
