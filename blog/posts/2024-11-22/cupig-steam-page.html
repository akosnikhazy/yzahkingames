        <h1>Getting wishlists is hard</h1>
        <div id="postedat">by √Åkos <time datetime="2024-11-22">2024-11-22</time></div>
        <p>Cupig's Key Collectathon already has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2999220/Cupigs_Key_Collectathon/">Steam page</a>, but not many wishlists. This is because the page, and the game itself, are not very appealing to people who stumble upon it.</p>

        <p>This is not intentional. It happened because I am not making this game to be successful, but to learn the whole process of making a game from scratch to Steam release. Part of that process is making a page on Steam. Also to get a lot of wishlists.</p>

        <p>Making wishlists for the very low conversion rate at launch is a difficult task, and I have no resources to do it properly. What I can do is put up nicer images and better text to explain the game. Steam shows games to users and they can decide if they are interested enough to make a wishlist.</p>

        <p>A harder audience to get is people who visit the Steam page on the web. I link to it on all my social networks. But people have to click there, measure up the game, log in to Steam, and finally make a wishlist. It is a long way from the original link.</p>

        <p>I would never dream of advertising the game. I simply do not have the resources to do that on the scale that any product needs at the very least. The best I can do is to "beg" on social media. But that can be overdone and lead to unfollows. It feels like a hard balance to get. Especially if you are small.</p>

        <p>So here I am. Making this game, just to make a game. Trying to get it right, knowing it will go nowhere. I do not say that in a depressing way. I just want to experience the process. The next game will be different. It will be successful. At least I will try to make it that. It is a nice next goal to have.</p>
