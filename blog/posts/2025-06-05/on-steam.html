        <h1>I have no time</h1>

		<p>I finally put my game on Steam! Within a day, I had fixed a bunch of levels, tested the achievements, and fixed a bug that prevented the game from saving high scores after level 30.</p>
		<p>After all this, I began the process of reviewing the game, which meant uploading it to Steam. It's not a straightforward process. You have to learn about "depots" and releases, but that's understandable. Steam is a mature storefront that provides solutions for testing and selling games, game components, and bonus content. It is understandable why it is difficult.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwMPvEFFomE">This tutorial</a> helped me a lot. The only problem I encountered was that the upload process stopped at authentication. It turned out that my very long, special character-filled password was broken because of the Steam Pipe Build Uploader Tool (encoding is hard). I had to change password for a 0-9a-zA-Z type to log in. I reported this bug to Valve. They said they will remove this tool anyway and that I should use steamcmd.exe directly from the command prompt. Oh well.</p>
		<p>That said, it wasn't that bad. Now, I'm waiting for the Steam team to review my game and give it the green light.</p>
