        <h1>Every game neeeds assets... I can not do it all alone</h1>
        <div id="postedat">by √Åkos <time datetime="2025-03-20">2025-03-20</time></div>
		<p>Finally the first translation (German) for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2999220/Cupigs_Key_Collectathon/">Cupig's Key Collectathon</a> is finished.</p>
		<p>It is made by one of my friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/niiamin_cos">niiamin</a>. She is a cosplayer and cosplay photographer as well as an awesome crafter artist.  It is a big help that I can ask (and pay) friends to make translations for my game.</p>
		<p>Therefore, I have created a credits page for the game. It will list me, the translators, and any external assets used, such as music, sound effects, and fonts.</p>
		<p>This is a very small game, I made 90% of it. But I am not able to make my own music. I wanted to make my own fonts, but I just do not have the time to learn that. Maybe for the next project.</p>
