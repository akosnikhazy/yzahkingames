        <h1>Game Translation Started</h1>
        <div id="postedat">by Ákos <time datetime="2025-01-28">2025-01-28</time></div>
		<p>The development of <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2999220/Cupigs_Key_Collectathon/">Cupig's Key Collectathon</a> has finally reached the point where I have finished the text for it. I have a nice JSON file with all the English text.</p>
		<p>I have already given it to one of my friends to do the German translations. I will do the Hungarian and I have also planned to do the Ukrainian with one of my friends. Of course I will pay them for their work and I will mention them in the credits.</p>
		<p>Depending on how the game performs, I may do more translations, but at the moment I have neither the money nor the time to do more. My friends are an asset in this and they are a big help.</p>
		<p>My game uses JSON files loaded at scene start for text. It templates numbers and names on the fly. So even dynamic text is possible. This allowed me to do language support. I am very happy with it and will continue to use it in future games. I also see the limitations, in much larger games this could be resource intensive, and it's a bit wasteful to load all the text when only some of it is needed in certain situations. But on this scale it is not a real problem. A solution would be to make different files for different situations (like menu, gameplay, tutorial levels etc). But that is a problem for a future game.</p>
