        <h1>Reverse feature creep</h1>
        <div id="postedat">by √Åkos <time datetime="2024-11-22">2024-11-25</time></div>
        <p>From the beginning of the development of Cupig's Key Collectathon, I had a counter in the game that counted the times the player died. I had no real plan for it, but it was natural that it was there.</p>
        <p>In the game, the timer does not stop when the player fails a level. The level resets instantly and the timer continues. At first I thought I would give a time penalty at the end for every death. But I realised it would be a double penalty. It is already a time penalty to be reset to the beginning.</p>
        <p>So I got rid of the counter. The game still counts it in the background, just in case. It might be a good measure of an achievement. But there is no visual representation for it anymore.</p>
        <p>I did not really expect to take features off the table in an already small game. But it just made no sense. The game is better off without that complexity.</p>
