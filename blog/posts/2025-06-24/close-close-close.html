        <h1>Cupig's Key Collectathon is on Steam (for review) #2</h1>
        <div id="postedat">by √Åkos <time datetime="2025-06-24">2025-06-24</time></div>
		<p>The first <a href="https://yzahkin.games/blog/posts/2025-06-05/on-steam.html">upload</a> of the game to Steam ended in rejection (they found bugs that prevented changing the language with the controller, despite me telling them it had full controller support, fair). So I worked more on the game. This event prompted me to fix some bugs and levels.</p>
		<p>The Steam review process does not care about bugs. They are reviewing whether what I wrote about the game on the Steam page is true. They let me work on the game while the review process is ongoing. Some levels could not be physically won. Some levels had no start platform. These were easy to fix. This is why I did a full playthrough in the first place.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, I fixed some bugs and balanced the gameplay a bit. The dash move is less clunky now. Cupig doesn't lose height while performing it, so it feels better to control the little piggy. No more stucking on platforms. At first, I wanted to keep that in, but it felt annoying to play the game that way.</p>
		<p>The game is now up for review a second time. If it is accepted, I will release it in July. Otherwise, I will work on it more until it is accepted.</p>
