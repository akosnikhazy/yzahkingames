		<p>These are my older game projects and some other software that I keeping around.</p>
		<h2>An "every game" I never finished</h2>
			<p>This was a project to learn Unity. I started it in 2017. My idea was that it would be an "every game" game so I learn different game types. I lost my motivation after two levels. I kept the game though. You can try it by downloading it from itch.io<br>

			</p>
			<h2>A puzzle game concept about logic gates.</h2>
			<p>The idea was to make an educational game about logic gates with nature inspired graphics. I made the logic for all the gates, but this concept version only uses 3 of them. Most of the systems of the planned game work, but I felt I wouldn't play it, so I stopped making it. You can try it by downloading it from itch.io<br>

			<h2>My short lived HTML game adventure</h2>
			<p>When Flash finally died for the good of the internet, I tried to jump on HTML5. But it was just not the same for making games. I missed tweens and keyrames, and I still did not like Javascript as much as ActionScript 2. Nevertheless I made <a href="https://akosnikhazy.github.io/iro-sudoku/">Color Sudoku</a> a game where you solve puzzles without numbers. It is a very unfinished attempt at a game, but I had enough fun with the idea. It is free and open source.</p>

			<p>Also this was the time when Nintendo dropped the free picross games on 3DS. And I instantly wanted to make my own <a href="https://akosnikhazy.github.io/Javascript-Picross-Game/">Javascript Picross Game</a>. It is still functional. And ugly.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Small Flash Games</h2>
			<p>Back when Flash was a thing in the early 10's <a href="https://yzahkin.newgrounds.com/games">I created several small games</a>. They are still working thanks to Newgrounds' swf player. Also <a href="https://flashmuseum.org/browse/developer/akos-nikhazy/">this website archived</a> more of my flash games. They are indeed small, the longest I worked on them was a month maximum. And reused a lot of code. Most of them use the now defunct Mochi Games API, so no leaderboards work in any of them anymore. On the other hand some of the games still use the Newground API and they have achievements to earn.</p>

			<h2>Some other things I made and still like to have around</h2>
			<p>My <a href="https://akosnikhazy.github.io/cistercian-numerals/">Cistercian numeral generator</a> will give you hours of medieval fun! A more serious thing is <a href="https://akosnikhazy.github.io/self-contained-encrypter1.1/">the self contained encrypter</a>. It can generate an HTML file that asks for a password to decrypt the text or even images you put in it. It also works offline.</p>
			<p>Once I even made a tool to <a href="https://github.com/akosnikhazy/Budapest-Temperature">visualise temperature data</a>. It creates an image where each row is a year and each column is a day. I am just happy with how it turned out.</p>
